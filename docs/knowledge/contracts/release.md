# Release

Longhorn releases one coordinated version across the Rust workspace and the
three npm packages. The npm packages publish to npm under `@inflatable-cookie`
through trusted publishing. The Rust crates are `publish = false`; consumers
take them by git tag, so the Rust half of a release is the tag itself.
Tom approves each release. What a candidate must prove is owned by
[contract 012](012-distribution-and-compatibility.md#release-evidence).

## Version source

The version lives in `Cargo.toml` `workspace.package.version`. Proofs and
boundary tests read that field. Do not hand-edit version literals in
`scripts/` or the adapter peers. `config/release.toml` is the only
`[release]` and `[release.gates]` definition; `effigy.toml` includes it.

## Steps

1. **Bump.** `effigy release:bump -- <version>` updates the workspace version
   and internal pins, the three npm versions and adapter peers, the
   agent-control skill stamp, promotes `[Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` to a
   dated heading, runs `sync:prototype-locks`, and regenerates the API
   reference. It is idempotent at the same version and refuses a
   non-increasing one. A lock change other than a Longhorn path-package
   version is a stop. It never tags.
2. **Land the bump** as its own reviewable PR. Do not commit a scratch bump
   used only as evidence.
3. **CI on the exact commit.** CI is manual dispatch:
   `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>`. Wait for green.
4. **Rehearse.** `effigy ci:rehearse` on that commit. It checks the
   clean-runner properties that local `qa` can miss.
5. **Gates.** `effigy release status --check-gates` and read the gate lines.
   A nonzero exit on an empty `[Unreleased]` is a known Effigy gap (a Queue
   papercut); the gate results are the evidence.
6. **Dry run.** `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f dry-run=true`.
   It runs full QA, the release gates and pack-and-verify.
7. **Tag and publish.** Dispatch the workflow against the tag, not `main`:

   ```sh
   git tag -a v<version> -m "Longhorn <version>" && git push origin v<version>
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref v<version> -f dry-run=false
   ```

   There is no `push: tags` trigger: publication is an act someone performs,
   not a side effect of pushing a tag.

## Gates

`[release.gates]` in `config/release.toml` runs cheapest-first, in
declaration order: private-candidate, advisories, rustdoc, prototypes,
workspace (`effigy qa`), floor (MSRV Clippy and tests), source (git-dependency
consumer). `effigy release:gates` is the same list minus `workspace`;
`check:release-gates` fails if the two drift. `effigy test:release-tooling`
covers the bump and the alignment check.

Effigy `release prepare` cannot see the eight workspace-excluded
`prototypes/*/Cargo.lock` files. `sync:prototype-locks` is the pre-gate
rewrite: Longhorn path-package versions only, then
`cargo metadata --locked --offline`. Do not fold it into `[release.gates]` or
weaken `check:prototypes --locked`.

When bumping `LONGHORN_GENERAL_MSRV`, run `effigy release:floor` in the same
change. The floor unlocks MSRV-gated Clippy lints.

## Publishing credentials

No `NPM_TOKEN`. npmjs.com accepts publishes for each package only from this
repository and `release.yml`, authenticated by a per-run OIDC token, with
provenance attached. A new package needs its trusted publisher configured at
npmjs.com before its first release; until then the publish step fails closed.
The workflow runs Effigy through `inflatable-cookie/setup-effigy`. Never use
`bunx effigy` there: an unrelated npm package has that name.

## Verify

- The release run is green: full QA, gates, tag-version check,
  pack-and-verify, publish.
- `npm view @inflatable-cookie/<package>@<version> dist.integrity` equals the
  packed artifact from the release run, for all three packages.
- Both adapters peer on `@inflatable-cookie/longhorn` at the exact version.
- The annotated tag dereferences to the released commit.
- Send consumers the exact pins: npm versions and the git tag.

## Roll back

- npm versions are immutable. Fix forward with a patch release. Use
  `npm deprecate` on a bad version if consumers must be steered away.
- Never move or delete a pushed tag; consumers pin it. Cut a new one.
- A failed publish run that published nothing can be re-dispatched against
  the same tag.
